CryptoAuthLib - Atmel CryptoAuthentication Library       {#mainpage}
====================================================

Introduction
------------------------
This code base implements an object-oriented C library which supports
Atmel CryptoAuth devices.  The family of devices supported currently are:

- [ATECCx08A (ATECC108A, ATECC508A)](http://www.atmel.com/devices/ATECC508A.aspx)
- [ATSHA204A](http://www.atmel.com/products/security-ics/cryptoauthentication/sha-256.aspx)

Prerequisite skills:
  - strong C programming and code reading
  - Atmel Studio familiarity
  - Knowledge of flashing microcontrollers with new code
  - Familiarity with Atmel CryptoAuth device functionality

Prerequisite hardware to run CryptoAuthLib examples:
  - [ATSAMR21 Xplained Pro](http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATSAMR21-XPRO.aspx)
or
  - [ATSAMD21 Xplained Pro](http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATSAMD21-XPRO.aspx)

  - [CryptoAuth Xplained Pro Extension](http://www.atmel.com/tools/CryptoAuthXplainedPro.aspx)
or 
  - [socketed top-board for ATCK101](http://www.atmel.com/tools/at88ck101.aspx) to accept chip packages of your choice 

For most development, using socketed top-boards is preferable until your configuration 
is well tested, then you can commit it to a CryptoAuth Xplained Pro Extension, for example.
Keep in mind that once you lock a device, it will not be changeable.

Examples
-----------

  - watch [CryptoAuthLib Documents](http://www.atmel.com/tools/CryptoAuthLib.aspx?tab=documents) for
new examples coming online.  
  - ATECC508A Node Authentication Example Using Asymmetric PKI is a complete,
all-in-one example demonstrating all the stages of crypto authentication starting from provisioning
the Crypto Authentication device with keys and certificates to demonstrating an authentication 
sequence using asymmetric techniques.

Release notes
-----------
07/01/2017
  - Removed assumption of SN[0:1]=0123, SN[8]=EE. SN now needs to be passed in
for functions in atca_host and atca_basic functions will now read the config
zone for the SN if needed.
  - Renamed atcab_gendig_host() to atcab_gendig() since it's not a host
function. Removed original atcab_gendig(), which had limited scope.
  - Fixed atcah_hmac() for host side HMAC calculations. Added atcab_hmac().
  - Removed unnecessary ATCADeviceType parameters from some atca_basic
functions.
  - Added atcacert_create_csr() to create a signed CSR.
  - New HAL implementation for Kit protocol over HID on Linux
    Please see the Incorporating CryptoAuthLib in a Linux project using USB HID devices section
    in this file for more information.
  - Added atcacert_write_cert() for writing certificates to the device.
  - Added support for dynamic length certificate serial numbers in atcacert.
  - Added atcab_write() for lower level write commands.
  - Fixed atcah_write_auth_mac(), which had wrong OpCode.
  - Added atcab_verify() command for lower level verify commands.
  - Added atcab_verify_stored() for verifying data with a stored public key.
  - Removed atcab_write_bytes_slot(). Use atcab_write_bytes_zone() instead.
  - Modified atcab_write_bytes_zone() and atcab_read_bytes_zone() to specify a slot.
  - Added atcab_verify_validate() and atcab_verify_invalidate()
  - Improvements to host functions to handle more cases.
  - Added atcab_updateextra(), atcab_derive_key()
  - Added support for more certificate formats.
  - Added general purpose hardware SHA256 functions. See atcab_hw_sha2_256().
  - Removed device specific config read/write. Generic now handles both.
  - Removed unnecessary response parameter from lock commands.
  - Enhanced and added unit tests.
  - Encrypted read and write functions now handle keys with SlotConfig.NoMac set.
  - atcab_cmp_config_zone() handles all devices now.
  - Fixed some edge cases in atcab_read_bytes_zone().

Host Device Support
---------------

CryptoAuthLib will run on a variety of platforms from small micro-controllers to
desktop host systems.  The current list of hardware abstraction layer support includes:

Rich OS Hosts:
  - Linux Kit Protocol over CDC USB
  - Windows Kit Protocol over CDC USB
  - Windows Kit Protocol over HID USB

Microcontrollers:
  - SAMD21 (I2C and SWI)
  - SAMR21 (I2C and SWI)
  - SAM4S (I2C)
  - AVR XMEGA A3BU (I2C and SWI)
  - SAMV71

If you have specific microcontrollers or Rich OS platforms you need support for,
please contact us through the Atmel support portal with your request.

CryptoAuthLib Architecture
----------------------------
See the 'docs' directory of CryptoAuthLib for supporting documentation
including architecture diagrams and more detailed usage docs.

The library is structured to support portability to:
  - multiple hardware/microcontroller platforms
  - multiple environments including bare-metal, Windows, and Linux OS
  - multiple chip communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART, and SWI)

All platform dependencies are contained within the HAL (hardware abstraction layer).

![CryptoAuthLib Architecture](../CryptoAuthLib-Architecture.png "CryptoAuthLib Architecture" )

There are three primary object types in CryptoAuthLib:
  - Device (ATCADevice)
  - Command (ATCACommand)
  - Interface (ATCAIface)
  
ATCADevice is a composite object made up of ATCACommand ATCAIface.

![ATCADevice](../cryptoauthlib-uml/ATCADevice.png "ATCADevice and ATCACommand object" )
![ATCAIface](../cryptoauthlib-uml/ATCAIFace.png "ATCAIface object" )
![Hardware abstraction layer](../cryptoauthlib-uml/ATCAHal.png "CryptoAuth hardware abstraction layer" )

Currently, the vast majority of testing has been performed on:

  - ATSAMR21 Xplained Pro (cryptoauth-r21-host firmware)
  - ATSAMD21 Xplained Pro (cryptoauth-d21-host firmware)
  - ATSAMV71 Xplained Pro (cryptoauth-v71-host firmware)
  - Windows (cryptoauthlib-win-host)

These host containers implement a host test environment and
test console to exercise tests.  They presume that a CryptoAuth Xplained Pro
or other I2C socket for an ATECC508A are connected to the I2C pins of the
host Xplained Pro development board or in the case of windows is using a 
HID connection to an  ATCK101 or ATCK590.

The unit tests and basic tests exercise the core datasheet commands of
the device as well as the more convenient, basic API methods.

If you need an example of how to use a command, these hosts and tests are a good
place to reference.

Object Architecture
--------------------------
Even though this is a C library, it follows object-oriented design patterns.

An object is minimally defined to be data and the actions which operate on that data.

Each CryptoAuth device is a composite object, a structure which includes
the command table (list of commands) which are valid for the device, and the
data used to hold the state of that device.

ATCADevice is the object which represents the Atmel CryptAuth device

ATCACommand is the object which represents the valid methods of the Device.

ATCAInterface is the physical interface object (I2C or SWI instance).
Currently, each Device may have a single OATCAInterface.

ATCADevice represents an ATSHA or ATECC family device.

In order to add new protocol support for a platform, you provide a HAL
(hardware abstraction layer) C file for the protocol and target.  In your
project's IDE or Makefile, you select which HAL support you need for the 
hardware configuration.  Generally, there are separate files for each 
protocol and platform combination - (ie: samd21_i2c_asf.c would target SAMD21 
MCUs with I2C using the ASF low-level driver support.)

Directory Structure
-----------------------
```bash
./lib - The primary library source code
./lib/docs - AppNotes and Doxygen HTML documentation for the library API. Load "index.html" in your browser
./lib/basic - the Basic API way to access the core classes
./lib/atcacert - cert data and cert i/o methods
./lib/hal - hardware abstraction layer code for supporting specific platforms
./lib/crypto - software implementation of crypto algorithms 

./test - Unity test code to exercise unit tests for datasheet commands and Basic API methods
./lib/atcacert/test - Unity test code to exercise all CryptoAuthLib certificate features

For production code, test directories should be excluded by not compiling it into
a project, so it is up to the developer to include or not as needed.  Test code adds
significant bulk to an application - it's not intended to be included in production code.
```

Tests
------------

There is a set of unit tests found in the test directory which will at least
partially demonstrate the use of the objects.  Some tests may depend upon a 
certain device being configured in a certain way and may not work for all
devices or specific configurations of the device.

Using CryptoAuthLib (Atmel CryptoAuth Library)
===========================================

Using a new library is often easier when you can load an example and see how 
it works.  We've provided examples in the form of "host containers" which are
host projects that incorporate CryptoAuthLib and target various processors
or communication APIs.

We maintain host test containers for each of the HAL layers we support.  
We've published the host container for SAMD21 which demonstrates a simple
console interface to invoke test runners.

Look for:
  - cryptoauth-d21-host

at the Atmel CryptoAuthentication web pages or in GitHub.

The best way to learn how to use CryptoAuthLib is to study the host test
projects that exercise the library and ATECC and ATSHA devices.

New examples will be forthcoming as the software matures.  Continue checking 
the [CryptoAuthentication](http://www.atmel.com/products/security-ics/cryptoauthentication/default.aspx?tab=documents) 
web page for new updates.

Using Git to Incorporate CryptoAuthLib as a Submodule
-----------------------------------
You can include this project in your own project under git.

Using CryptoAuthLib as a git submodule, you can maintain your application separately 
from CryptoAuthLib.

If your project is already in in git but you haven't yet intergrated 
CryptoAuthLib, change to the directory where you want to put CryptoAuthLib

```bash
git submodule add -b master <giturl to CryptoAuthLib>
```

This adds CryptoAuthLib as a subdirectory and separate git repo within your
own project.  Changes and commits to your project vs CryptoAuthLib will remain
separated into each respective repository.

If there is a project you want to checkout that already incorporates CryptoAuthLib
as a submodule if you clone the repo that incorporates CryptoAuthLib, after cloning, 
you'll still need to fill out the CryptoAuthLib submodule after cloning:
```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote
cd cryptoauthlib
git checkout master
```

Now that CryptoAuthLib is a full-fledged submodule in your git project, in order to 
easily add it to your project within Atmel Studio, please see this [tip](
http://avrstudio5.wordpress.com/2011/07/12/tip-add-existing-multiple-files-and-folders-to-an-avr-studio-project-quickly/)

Incorporating CryptoAuthLib in a project
-----------------------------------------
1) In your Makefile or IDE, choose the HAL support you need from the HAL directory and exclude other 
HAL files from your project.

2) For I2C interfaces, define the symbol ATCA_HAL_I2C in your compiler's symbol definitions.  This will
hook up the CryptoAuthLib interface class with your HAL implementation of I2C methods.

3) HAL implementations for CDC and HID interfaces to the ATCK101 are also included for
use with Windows or Linux versions of the test host.

Incorporating CryptoAuthLib in a Linux project using USB HID devices
-----------------------------------------
The Linux HID HAL files use the Linux udev development software package.

To install the udev development package under Ubuntu Linux, please type the following
command at the terminaLlwindow:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
```

This adds the udev development development software package to the Ubuntu Linux installation.


The Linux HID HAL files also require a udev rule to be added to change the permissions of the 
USB HID Devices.  Please add a new udev rule for the Atmel CryptoAuth USB devices.

```bash
cd /etc/udev/rules.d
sudo touch atmel-cryptoauth.rules
```

Edit the atmel-cryptoauth.rules file and add the following line to the file:

SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2312", MODE="0666"
